    "description" : "<h2>â€”Overviewâ€”<\/h2>\n<p  class=\"top\"> The <b>Camino de Santiago<\/b> is a collection of ancient pilgrimage trails all leading to the historic city of <b>Santiago de Compostela<\/b> in northwest Spain. <\/p>\n\n<h2>â€”What's Included in this Datasetâ€”<\/h2>\n<p  class=\"top\">Overall, this is a detailed and in-depth dataset with over 3,000 entries covering well over 1,500 km of trails, with details on communities, albergues and other accommodations, major attractions, walking directions, and more. Under our classification system, we consider this a <i>Level 4 In-Depth Dataset<\/i>. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, because there are so many different Camino routes and because there are so many alternative portions for most routes, we'll likely be adding additional Camino content for a looooooong time to come. Thus, the level of coverage depends on the specific route you are interested in. For the major routes like the <i>FrancÃ©s<\/i> or the Central route of the <i>PortuguÃ©s<\/i>, the coverage is in-depth. Other routes might not have any coverage at all (so far...). <\/p>\n\n<p>We currently have good coverage of:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Camino FrancÃ©s<\/b>: Saint Jean Pied de Port to Santiago.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Camino PortuguÃ©s<\/b>: Porto to Santiago via the Central route (with coverage of the Coastal route as far as Vila do Conde).<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Camino Primitivo<\/b>: Oviedo to Santiago.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Finisterre Extension<\/b>: From Santiago to \"land's end\" at Cape Finisterre (Fisterra).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Our plan is to steadily add new routes while continuing to expand coverage of our existing ones. If there is a Camino route you'd like us to cover, let us know and we'll try to prioritize it. If you can help us with the content, that would be even better! :-) <\/p>\n",
