    "description" : "<h2>â€”Overviewâ€”<\/h2>\n<p  class=\"top\"> The <b>Camino de Santiago<\/b> is a collection of ancient pilgrimage trails all leading to the historic city of <b>Santiago de Compostela<\/b> in northwest Spain. <\/p>\n\n<h2>â€”What's Included in this Datasetâ€”<\/h2>\n<p  class=\"top\">Overall, this is a detailed and in-depth dataset with over 3,000 entries covering well over 1,500 km of trails, with details on communities, albergues and other accommodations, major attractions, walking directions, and more. Under our classification system, we consider this a <i>Level 4 In-Depth Dataset<\/i>. <\/p>\n\n<p>However, because there are so many different Camino routes and because there are so many alternative portions for most routes, we'll likely be adding additional Camino content for a looooooong time to come. Thus, the level of coverage depends on the specific route you are interested in. For the major routes like the <i>FrancÃ©s<\/i> or the Central route of the <i>PortuguÃ©s<\/i>, the coverage is in-depth. Other routes might not have any coverage at all (so far...). <\/p>\n\n<p>We currently have good coverage of:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Camino FrancÃ©s<\/b>: Saint Jean Pied de Port to Santiago.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Camino PortuguÃ©s<\/b>: Porto to Santiago via the Central route (with coverage of the Coastal route as far as Vila do Conde).<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Camino Primitivo<\/b>: Oviedo to Santiago.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><b>Finisterre Extension<\/b>: From Santiago to \"land's end\" at Cape Finisterre (Fisterra).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Our plan is to steadily add new routes while continuing to expand coverage of our existing ones. If there is a Camino route you'd like us to cover, let us know and we'll try to prioritize it. If you can help us with the content, that would be even better! :-) <\/p>\n",

    "description" : "<h2>What Makes it Great<\/h2>\n<p class=\"top\">The <b>Great Ocean Walk<\/b> is one of Australiaâ€™s premier hikes and is increasingly on many peopleâ€™s â€˜must-doâ€™ list. Located in the province of Victoria about 200 km \/ 124 mi southwest of <b>Melbourne<\/b>, the trail meanders along Australiaâ€™s rugged southern coast for approximately 100 km \/ 62 mi from the tourist town of <b>Apollo Bay<\/b> to the iconic <b>Twelve Apostles<\/b> landforms near the town of <b>Port Campbell<\/b>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The walk can be done as a through-hike or as a series of day-hikes (the trail passes many car parks along the way). There are eco-friendly campgrounds available (advance booking required) or you can stay at one of the many guesthouses in the region and use pick-up \/ drop-off services to get you back and forth to the trail. <\/p>\n\n<p>Typically done over 8 days and following well-maintained paths, there is nicely varying terrain ranging from dramatic clifftops to long sandy beaches to enveloping jungle. Lots of wildlife can be seen including kangaroos, koalas, wombats, and, in season, whales. There are a wide variety of birds, too, including the kukkaburra with its distinctive and occasionally startling â€˜laughâ€™. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Characteristics<\/h2>\n<p class=\"top\">This is a hike-only trail. It is easy-to-moderate in difficulty (generally getting more difficult as you progress), and is well-signposted. It is a wilderness trail (though never all that far from a road) and is occasionally rugged. The trail is well maintained with good footing. It is a uni-directional trail that is only done westward. Water is generally not a problem &mdash; there are untreated rainwater tanks at most of the campgrounds, though water availability is not guaranteed.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>What's Included in this Dataset<\/h2>\n<p class=\"top\">This trail dataset is detailed and in-depth.
